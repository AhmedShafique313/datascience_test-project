Aircraft Description
Beautiful must see airplane with brand new paint and interior.
Two Rolls-Royce Mk 611-8 engines provide 13,850 lbs of thrust each. Inspection interval is 8,000 hours. The Roll-Royce upgraded engine is responsible for 15% improved fuel consumption and decreased noise levels. Another
addition is the six-screen, color EFIS. The Honeywell SPZ-8000 avionics suite is found in the GIVSP’s cockpit. It includes Collins radios, FMS and dual Honeywell laser inertial reference systems.
The GIVSP is an ideal midsize, intercontinental-range business jet. Gulfstream’s aircraft have evolved through new technologies and improvements, and the GIVSP is evidence of this. With a new design, upgraded engines and additional space, the GIVSP offers great performance in the intercontinental class of jets; so great that Gulfstream modeled most of their latest jets off of the GIVSP

As a brand new member of this wonderful industry, I was amazed at AvBuyer’s customer service from moment 1. Outstanding patience with a newbie like myself, excellent follow-up on inquiries, and proactive sending of ad statistics so we can measure how well our ad performs. Our AvBuyer Sales executive, Lise Margin, has unparalleled accessibility and follow-up, which is so important in this fast-moving business.

This may have been the first time I have used AvBuyer, however, it will not be the last, I am absolutely impressed by the customer service, the speed in which they got the ad posted, the responses I received, and the customer support I received.

As a brand new member of this wonderful industry, I was amazed at AvBuyer’s customer service from moment 1. Outstanding patience with a newbie like myself, excellent follow-up on inquiries, and proactive sending of ad statistics so we can measure how well our ad performs. Our AvBuyer Sales executive, Lise Margin, has unparalleled accessibility and follow-up, which is so important in this fast-moving business.

This may have been the first time I have used AvBuyer, however, it will not be the last, I am absolutely impressed by the customer service, the speed in which they got the ad posted, the responses I received, and the customer support I received.
Tina Lindberg, Mansfield Heliflight
""As a broker who extensively engages in cross-border transactions, AvBuyer is a must go-to resource for information on the global marketplace for available aircraft. The metrics support that AvBuyer is the right choice for the international aircraft broker to sell one's plane.""

Detailed Description
Up for consideration is my 1973 Cessna 150. Good paint, smooth running, nice flying. What else can I say? It is 52 years old and not a Gulfstream, but it's just an honest little airplane that has plenty of enjoyment left to give. The only reason for selling is I've upgraded to a larger platform to better meet my intended mission. If I could keep both, I would, because it's the most fun you can have at 5-6 GPH... even if you don't admit it to your friends.
Thanks for looking!

Engine was topped about 900 hours ago. Compression numbers at last Annual were 79,78,75, and 75/80. Has an oil sump heating pad that works phenomenal in the winter.
Interior / Exterior
Interior is mostly original. Has some cracking going on, but still serviceable and doesn't look bad. Paint shows well, it has a nice shine and there are no thin spots. The fiberglass tip-cap on the vert shows some cracking, but don't they all? Airplane has been hangared under my ownership as well as the last owner, so the last 7 years. (Lives outside as of today since my ""new"" aircraft has arrived.)
Remarks
Annual Due 11/2024

Garmin VFR GPS is updated monthly and will be up to date at time of sale.
Will come with a fresh Oil/Filter change.
Times will change as she is still going to be actively flown even though I have a new toy to play with.

Detailed Description
New to market! 2010 Gulfstream G200 sn 235. One of the Latest Produced, Strong US Only Pedigree, Engines on ESP Gold | APU on MSP Gold, Spacious 9 Passenger Configuration, ATG-4000 WiFi, FANS 1/A+, Autothrottles, WAAS / LPV Equipped.
The G200 has a maximum range of 3400 NM with IFR reserves. For most domestic U.S. trips, the fuel efficient G200 needs only 5,000 feet to takeoff and fly from Los Angeles to New York with eight passengers aboard. Two Pratt and Whitney 306A engines produce enviable range and speed, while keeping fuel consumption low. Normal cruise is 447 kts., burning just 1,800 lbs/268 gals of fuel per hour. The auxiliary power unit - for ground cooling, ground heating and engine start - is a reliable Honeywell
GTCP36-150.
The 24.5 foot long cabin is light and airy with enough personal space for work or rest. At 6'2"" inches, the G200 cabin has more headroom than a GIV, and only 2 inches less floor width. Twelve panoramic windows infuse the cabin with natural light. Baggage space simply is not an issue in the G200 boasting an externally-accessed baggage bay providing a significant 150 cubic feet of storage.

You want to buy a jet, but how should you do it? Sole ownership gives you complete control and is an excellent option we offer. But what if you don't quite fly enough to justify the cost? Other ownership models like fractional, membership plans, and supplemental charter add complication without dramatically cutting down your cost per hour. Splitting the aircraft cost is the best way to cut your expenses, but a self-managed partnership is high risk, high stress, and it may end badly. It's time to rethink your approach to partnership with Vair. Vair co-ownership simplifies the entire process of jet ownership, while matching you up with a responsible partner to share the costs. With Vair managed co-ownership owning a jet is finally a smart decision. Convenient access, effortless ownership, and dramatic savings; that's what Vair will do for you.
Benefits:
- Tax Deductible Assets
- Time / Money Saved
- All Flight Crew Fully Managed
- All Aircraft Maintenance Fully Managed
- Easy Scheduling Through Online Portal
- ARGUS Platinum Certified / IS-BAO Compliant
- Nationwide Coverage

Interior
The cabin consists of six VIP seats and an aft three place divan. The forward zone has four VIP seats in a double club configuration. The aft zone has two VIP seats on the right-hand side of the cabin across from a three place divan.
Galley
There is a forward right-side galley equipped with a microwave oven, coffee maker, and ample storage for catering supplies. A jumpseat is located in the galley with approval for taxi, take-off and landing. This is ideal for a flight attendant or an extra pilot for longer journeys.
Media
There are two monitors throughout the cabin: one in the forward left-hand bulkhead and the other in the aft left-hand bulkhead. The AirShow 4000 system is installed giving up to date information on the aircraft’s location, flight time remaining, altitude and other flight details. A data port and VGA port are in the right-hand side rail providing media connections for personal devices to cast through the entertainment system. In the tail of the aircraft is an external view camera wired to broadcast its view onto the cabin displays.
A dual DVD Player is in the forward galley enabling two DVDs to be watched simultaneously on the different monitors in the cabin.
There are five electric units in the cabin, each with two plugs. Each outlet has one plug wired with a universal plug interface and 230V / 50Hz electricity, and another plug with a USA interface and 115V / 60Hz electricity. Outlet units are located in the galley and lavatory, and three units throughout the seating areas.
The aircraft’s ICS-200 SATCOM System satellite phone uses the Iridium network. There are two handsets in the cabin: a corded handset in the side ledge of the forward club section and a cordless handset in the aft closet in the lavatory.
Lavatory
The aft VIP lavatory is enclosing via a hard pocket door for maximum privacy for passengers. There is a large closet for storing in flight items and other cabin amenities.

Description
The Gulfstream IVSP is the second iteration in the popular Gulfstream series. Known for its
performance and reliability, this particular aircraft is a large cabin, long-range airplane that seats
up to 13 passengers comfortably in three discreet living zones.
One of the most significant improvements is the upgrade of engines from the Rolls-Royce Spey
to the Rolls-Royce Tay Mk 611-8, used in later model jets including the G300 and 400. The Roll-
Royce upgraded engine is responsible for 15% improved fuel consumption and decreased noise
levels. This successful intercontinental-range business jet has been a prototype for later
Gulfstream models.
Meticulously serviced and maintained, Avjet Global is pleased to offer this very special aircraft
on behalf of its client. We invite inquiries from serious buyers looking to invest in an aviation
asset of great beauty and enduring value.
